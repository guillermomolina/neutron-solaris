    neutron-solaris can now be installed through its own devstack plugin.
    This is mandatory when using the "solaris" ML2 mechanism driver.

    Including the following line in the devstack local.conf file will enable
    the plugin:
    enable_plugin neutron-solaris https://github.com/openstack/neutron-solaris
